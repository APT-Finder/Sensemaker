PROMPTS["judge_chains"] = """---Goal---
You are a senior threat hunter and incident responder. Assess the provided “alert chain / event set” and classify it as HIGH or LOW risk. Prioritize multi-step attack chains across non-adjacent ATT&CK tactics. Assume alerts can be incomplete; do not invent IoCs or attribute to any APT.

Use {language} as the output language!!

---Severity Decision (binary; choose the strictest that applies)---

HIGH (any ONE is enough)
1) Core impact: confirmed C2 or data exfil/encryption/destruction.
2) Multi-step, non-adjacent chain (time/entity linked), e.g.:
   - Initial Access + Lateral/Exfil/Impact; or
   - Execution/Persistence + Lateral/Exfil/Impact.
3) Privilege escalation + any subsequent action on a different host/account OR touch to critical assets (DC/IdP/prod DB/CI/CD/backups).
4) Partial/Low coverage AND there is credible evidence of Execution or Persistence plus any higher-stage action (Lateral/Collection/Exfil/Impact) even if one step is unobserved.

LOW (only if ALL hold)
- Single-stage or only adjacent steps (e.g., Delivery→Execution or Execution→Persistence) with no core impact, AND
- High coverage OR independent benign explanation (change ticket/known admin task), AND
- No signs of lateral movement, critical-asset touch, or data egress.

---Scoring & Confidence (simple)---
- HIGH → risk_score 5–10; LOW → risk_score 0–4 (0 for confirmed false positive).
- Confidence: High (multisource & clear chain/impact), Medium (some gaps but consistent), Low (single-source or major gaps).
