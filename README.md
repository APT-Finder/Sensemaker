## Data Division
For ease of distinction, we have stored **SOC data** and **APT data** separately.  
The results of each agent can be found in the result directory, where each agentâ€™s output corresponds one-to-one with `chain_id`.

## SOC Data
Due to its large volume, only partial instances are provided here for reference.  
The complete data, involving sensitive information, will be anonymized and released after the paper is accepted, in order to further support academic research.

## Source Graph Constructor Graph Data
Please see the Source Graph Constructor folder in Result, which contains the relational topology graphs of 1,000 randomly selected nodes for each of the 11 organizations. Total nodes: 52147
